Services are used from common data
syntax for creating service : ng generate service service-name
we get components from Services:
    -> Depedency Injection - it is a design pattern which create a new instance of parent values in the child so that if parent changes the values aslo child will not get effected.
    -> to change depedency ijection in angular we will inject the service in the parameters of constructor
    for API we need to use default service HttpCilent

1. first we need to import HttpClientModule in module.ts
2. go to service and inject HttpClient

HttpCilent return obvervable, it means multiple promises, u will resolve it by subscribe
